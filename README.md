# Reddit

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.1.0.

## Planning

* As a user, I want to click a category to visit its collection of posts.
* As a user, I want to see several discussion categories (sub-reddits, boards, etc.) on the main page.
* As a user, I want to click a post to view its contents (For now simply hide/show contents. Routing to a page for a * specific post requires concepts from tonight's homework).
* As a user, I want to click on a post to expand/collapse it, so I can view whatever funny picture, link, or news * article other users have posted.
* As a user, I want to add new posts to a discussion category.
* As a user, I want to update my post as necessary.
* As a user, I want the option to delete my post.

Steps:
1) add class models for subreddit and posts
2) hard code some subreddits (use a service?)
3) add components to listing posts, post detail, adding new posts, and updating posts


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.
